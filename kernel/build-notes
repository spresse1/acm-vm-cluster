The following are build notes on making a xen-compatable kernel on a CentOS 6 machine.  These directions were developed using the spec file created by the elrepo.org folks.
If I stop being lazy, I'll turn this into a script.

To install all required packages:
# yum install rpm-build redhat-rpm-config patchutils xmlto asciidoc elfutils-libelf-devel zlib-devel binutils-devel newt-devel python-devel perl(ExtUtils::Embed) gtk2-devel bison

Get the kernel source from kernel.org, put it in rpmbuild/SOURCES/
$ cd rpmbuild/SOURCES; wget [source pkg]; cd

Copy in kernel config file
# cp [source] rpmbuild/SOURCES/config-[kernel-version]-i686
# cp [source] rpmbuild/SOURCES/config-[kernel-version]-i686-NONPAE
# cp [source] rpmbuild/SOURCES/config-[kernel-version]-x86_64

$ rpmbuild -ba kernel-ml-3.6.spec
